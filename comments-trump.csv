He fabricated and magnified false claims of voter fraud...with no evidence. 57 court cases...2 Supreme Court cases...all thrown out for lack of evidence. In desperation he took to his Twitter, to his fox news, to his megaphone...and repeated his lies over & over...he then told you that YOU were cheated..he made this personal for you...because you'll fight to the death to save yourselves...he'll just pretend to be your hero while he continues to use you as his shield...this was his insurance policy. Insurrection, a coup...all viable options for a mad man when a legal election fails to keep him safe. You've been conned into seditious acts against your own country. You let this mad man make your fellow Americans the enemy. All autocrats and dictators need a common enemy for their followers to focus on. He told you it was the left.

Why are many of you reading this, not considering a 1% possibility that Trump is right, and there is fraud in mail ballots.  Why people are not considering the possibility that someone is manipulating their elections?  Many Ameicans and non Americans are so in hurry to see him out without even knowing the truth.. As if once Trump leaves, the corona will disappear, Iran will stop its 20% uranium enrichment and will start working on receiving Nobel Prizes for Peace and Love.  Everything will be alright..

Idk why this a race thing. And it shouldnt be . There shouldnt any Trump flags or BlM flags when protesting . That's how the media divides us... we should all be protesting our rights and they are slowing getting taken away. If we all come together holding just the American flags it will speak volumes. Posting memes just divides us more. Government is corrupt and only we can do something about it but all of us together . No more hateing eachother.  Others might not agree but we need to put aside to our differences. #wereamericans üá∫üá∏,#wereamericans,2021-01-07T23:06:08+0000,,5.0

Jerusalem is now capital of Israel, which is sure to lead to the building of the prophesied 3rd Temple to come in Israel, leading to much more.  You were used for more than just politics, but helping the economy, seeing Bible prophecies see fulfillment, and much more.  Stay strong in American politics in the days ahead!

Your administration helped many in great time when the hurricanes hit, when floods happened, when wild land fires ravaged the west coast areas. You helped get us warpspeed help when the COVID 19 hit our country. It is not your fault that COVID has killed so many hundreds of thousands of people.

He is better than any presidents who were better for public speech that I have seen. The only thing he has been probably wrong is his disregard of COVID-19. I am an individual from Vietnam and we have actually taken a very good control on the pandemic by wearing masks, locking down borders and doing social distancing. By looking down on the spread of the disease, it is obviously a setback in his presidential carrier. However, he is still by far the best US President I have seen. ",,2021-01-07T02:56:51+0000,,1.0

Dear mr president Our government is in completely out of control. The democrats believe they are above the law. They do what ever they want without any regards to the law. Also very double standard.

Im deeply sorry that you were unable to accomplish everything you wanted to for us due to the fact the democrats fight everything. They don't care about us. They care about them selfs. The proof is everywhere. The governor of California closes everything except his company. Nancy desided she can get a hair cut but we can not. They can have partys laugh eat but we are on lock down. Now that the democrats are taking office I feel that the little freedom and rights we had are gone. I have always considered myself a independent voter. I liked and dislike things on both sides.

How was this any different than protests over the summer against our proud men in blue.l? Ur more concerned about ur legacy. So disappointed you let this country down just to appease a mob.

The reasons went from they had already voted according to the records, she had just gotten off work; voting machines in highly republican areas weren't working, no other precinct would allow them to vote; voting machines kept changing votes from Republican to Democratic and they wouldn't fix them.  This is why Republicans are getting so angry.  YOU won the election and when Pence's first statement was made in Congress, it should have been we need to have an investigation into the voting in all swing states.

This is what happens when the government does not listen to the voters. This is largely due to the media twisting the narrative on any story that was negative to the left and social media suppressing the truth.  Most people in America have no clue what actually is happening in the country due to the media. It is also caused by the voter fraud and with no court willing to listen or even see the evidence from the people who witnessed it and proved it. Currently these Trump supporters are being called domestic terrorists while rioters and looters this summer were never punished or held accountable and were called peaceful protestors.   I know everyone is blaming Trump but I disagree. This is our country‚Äôs frustration coming to a head!,,2021-01-06T23:53:13+0000,,3.0

"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed, by their Creator, with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.--That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government, laying its foundation on such principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate, that governments long established, should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shown, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.
